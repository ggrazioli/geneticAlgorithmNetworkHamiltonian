This main function carries out automated discovery of network Hamiltonian models
that can self-assemble into the 2-ribbon amyloid fibril topological structure.
The example used in the main function is very similar to the code used to generate 
the figure in the aforementioned article showing the evolution of different 
generations of models as the genetic algorithm converges on a region of parameter 
space that produces maximal fibril yield for 2-ribbon type amyloid fibril structures.
To give an idea of run time, this main function runs in under 10 minutes on a 
2019 MacBook Pro with a 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 processor and 64 GB of RAM. Users
who wish to apply the genetic algorithm toward developing network Hamiltonian models
for a particular graph structure of interest should use main.R script as a guide
for developing their script, and also modify fibril_assay.R so that it determines
membership in in the user's graph structure of interest.
